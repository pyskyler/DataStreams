00;40;55;28 - 00;40;57;24
Jordan
Just a short background on yourself.

00;40;57;27 - 00;41;28;29
Dennis
Okay. My name is Dennis Barrie and I am director of Experience design at the Western Reserve Historical Society. And I'm also, I'm principal of Berry Projects, which is a museum building, organization. You're sitting in our main office here. And my background, my background goes a long way back. I started at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and was there for 11 years.

00;41;28;29 - 00;41;46;17
Dennis
Then after that, I went to the contemporary Art Center in Cincinnati, where I was director and was there for, I think, eight years. And I came to, of course, rings now. I can't do you want to hold?

00;41;46;19 - 00;41;51;01
Jordan
Yeah, we can hold. Bridget Flower.

00;41;51;04 - 00;41;53;06
Dennis
That phone hardly ever rings.

00;41;53;09 - 00;41;54;10
Phone


00;41;54;13 - 00;41;58;24
Jordan
We got we got it on video.

00;41;58;26 - 00;42;05;03
Phone
Call from Bridget Flowers.

00;42;05;06 - 00;42;07;18
Phone
Called from Bridget.

00;42;07;20 - 00;42;14;06
Jordan
Louder, Bridget. Call from Bridget. Lover.

00;42;14;08 - 00;42;15;23
Dennis
Should we try again?

00;42;15;25 - 00;42;18;29
Jordan
Yeah. You just have to. You can just start from the background.

00;42;19;03 - 00;43;01;07
Dennis
Background. Okay, good. I worked at the Smithsonian Institution for 11 years documenting the arts in America, and then moved to Cincinnati to run the contemporary Art center. In 1983. And I was there for eight years. I left there in 91. And, in 1993, I became director of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, which I opened here in Cleveland and left there to go to be independent, an independent developer of museums.

00;43;01;09 - 00;43;36;20
Dennis
I worked for a private company, and we built the International Spy Museum in Washington, DC. And then we went on to do a lot of museums. Too many to mention, actually, maybe about 10 or 15 when I count them all. The last one being the, U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Museum in Colorado Springs. And now currently, I'm the advisor to the Western Reserve Historical Society, which is the historical society for the 13 counties of Northeast Ohio.

00;43;36;23 - 00;43;47;27
Jordan
That's awesome. Tell us a little bit about where, oh I'm skipping one. When did you first learn about the Perfect Moment exhibit, and what drew you to bring it to the CAC?

00;43;48;00 - 00;44;09;07
Dennis
Well, it was interesting that, the contemporary, I have to give a little background. The Contemporary Arts center had a very close relationship with the Whitney Museum in New York. And because we had we shared some trustees and so forth. And I happened to be at the Whitney and there was a Mapplethorpe exhibition on at the Whitney.

00;44;09;07 - 00;44;34;13
Dennis
And I thought, this is a great show. And I talked to the director and he said, we're not traveling this exhibition, but the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, is traveling a version of the exhibition, The Perfect Moment. So I called the director, Janet Kardon, and I said, do you have any openings for this show? And she said, yes.

00;44;34;14 - 00;45;16;28
Dennis
In fact, Houston just dropped out, if you would like that slot, which was to be, in the spring of 1990. And I said, we'll take it. So that was sometime, 1988, 89, something like that. That, we, I asked to have the exhibition come to Cincinnati. It wasn't a unilateral decision. Okay. With exhibitions that the Contemporary Arts Center, we had an exhibitions committee that was formed with staff, board members and artists, and we reviewed every exhibition that was presented by our staff or whoever.

00;45;17;01 - 00;45;27;01
Dennis
And the committee, loved the idea of the perfect moment of the Mapplethorpe show coming to the Contemporary Arts Center.

00;45;27;03 - 00;45;32;17
Jordan
Right. Can you tell us a little bit about Robert Mapplethorpe and the significance of his work?

00;45;32;19 - 00;45;56;13
Dennis
Yeah, I didn't know Robert personally. It's interesting. I knew so many people around him who were personal friends, including his longtime partner Sam Wagstaff, who I had known in Detroit. But I didn't know Robert. But I certainly knew of his work. And like I said, I saw his work at the Whitney. I'd seen his work at other exhibitions.

00;45;56;16 - 00;46;30;15
Dennis
You know, there he was. He was even then a controversial figure. Not because some people didn't value his work as much as as others did in the art world. Some people thought of him as being too much of a kind of society of fashion. Photographer, which is not a compliment. And some of the art world and, you know, and others thought his doing some rather incredible work because he was looking at what he did, wonderful still lifes like the flowers.

00;46;30;17 - 00;47;05;18
Dennis
And he was also doing work with a lot of male models, male nudity, which wasn't all that common in the 1980s, 70s, 80s and 90s. So he was I won't say it was groundbreaking, but he certainly was among those who were doing what I would say provocative work. He, the, the show at the Whitney and the show that traveled through the University of Pennsylvania were not his first show, but certainly among the most important.

00;47;05;20 - 00;47;17;26
Dennis
And the one that traveled was the one that created all the controversy because the one at the Whitney, it was New York. All kinds of people saw it. Nobody had anything to say.

00;47;17;29 - 00;47;20;01
Jordan
Thank you. Okay, that's all of you.

00;47;20;04 - 00;47;24;16
Skyler
If possible, would we be able to turn off the, air conditioning?

00;47;24;18 - 00;47;26;19
Dennis
Yeah. You're picking that up?

00;47;26;26 - 00;47;31;06
Skyler
Yeah. All right. That feature poetry, Eric.

00;47;31;08 - 00;47;32;17
Dennis
Hold on.

00;47;32;19 - 00;47;37;20
Skyler
I guess it is, heating season isn't it. It may not go off instantly.

00;47;37;22 - 00;47;38;29
Jordan
Should be all right.

00;47;39;02 - 00;47;48;08
Skyler
It's not bad, but. Yeah.

00;47;48;10 - 00;47;56;22
Skyler
It may take a while to get. It's in the off position, all right.

00;47;56;24 - 00;47;58;27
Jordan
But it's,

00;47;59;00 - 00;48;25;02
Dennis
It's it's there's a massive furnace right behind this house has two furnaces. Had to keep the horses.

00;48;25;05 - 00;48;28;01
Jordan
All right. We can give it a second to see if it goes off.

00;48;28;04 - 00;48;32;29
Skyler
You can.

00;48;33;01 - 00;48;46;03
Skyler
Try to work this way.

00;48;46;05 - 00;48;46;21
Skyler
I think if you.

00;48;46;21 - 00;48;49;11
Skyler
Want it to go on it's fine.

00;48;49;19 - 00;49;00;05
Jordan
Okay. So we will go on. Yeah. How did you feel about the exhibit when you first saw it? Did you think it would become controversial?

00;49;00;07 - 00;49;38;17
Dennis
No. Let me repeat the question. When I again, when I first saw the exhibition, was a version of it, which was the, what was presented at the Whitney Museum in New York. And it had many, all of the same photographs. And I thought they were mostly just beautiful, quite honestly, and nothing more than that. And I also thought, given the history of the contemporary Art Center in Cincinnati, that, they were the images were not that out of line with work that we had shown in the past.

00;49;38;17 - 00;49;55;13
Dennis
So I did not think of it as being anything that would be that controversial in Cincinnati. It only comes later that the controversy erupts. And so at the time that I said yes to the exhibition, there was no controversy.

00;49;55;16 - 00;49;58;07
Jordan
All right.

00;49;58;09 - 00;49;59;24
Jordan
What were the go ahead?

00;49;59;29 - 00;50;03;02
Dennis
You could do that. Yay!

00;50;03;04 - 00;50;12;03
Jordan
What were the first signs that the exhibit may, become controversial in Cincinnati? How did groups such as the media and CCV influence this?

00;50;12;08 - 00;50;49;10
Dennis
Well, let's go back another step and talk about when the when the exhibition became controversial because it became controversial before it came to Cincinnati and that is that in, in the spring of, of 1989, the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, which is among the oldest art museums in the United States, withdrew from the exhibition, with the fear that they would be thier

00;50;49;10 - 00;51;30;01
Dennis
funding would be cut off by the government. And that was the reason they took the exhibition down. Already there was controversy in, the Senate about the fact that the exhibition had received federal funding and it had received $30,000 from the National Endowment for the Arts to publish the catalog. And certain people, certain senators in, in Washington, were outraged by the fact that an exhibition that included nudes and some sexual acts would get money from the federal government.

00;51;30;04 - 00;52;02;18
Dennis
So in Washington, early in the 1989, there's already a controversy. And what happens is that, the Corcoran never shows the exhibition. There's a demonstration outside the building. They project images of Mapplethorpe on the building and eventually the show is, is presented in a small alternative gallery in Washington. So we already know there's going to be trouble.

00;52;02;22 - 00;52;30;02
Dennis
I know there's going to be trouble. In fact, I was at a meeting where of a museum directors in Providence, Rhode Island, and we were all horrified that the Corcoran was not going to show the exhibition and, in fact, that anybody who was going to show the exhibition was in trouble. So I knew then and there that things were going to get dicey.

00;52;30;05 - 00;52;54;27
Dennis
I went back to Cincinnati and I decided to tell, to show all the members of the board, all the images in the exhibition, and if they had some problems then we wouldn't go forward with the exhibition, that I would resign. And that was my intent to resign. If they wouldn't go forward. They all looked at them.

00;52;54;27 - 00;53;26;03
Dennis
They had some problems with some of them. Some of them they didn't understand, which is pretty funny. I won't go into gory details, but it was. The board agreed to go forward with the exhibition. So this is in the middle of 1989. The exhibition proceeds. It goes to Hartford, Connecticut. And in truth, there were two little old ladies that put signs up that they were upset with the exhibition, but nothing really happens.

00;53;26;05 - 00;54;08;09
Dennis
It goes on to Berkeley, California, and of course, in Berkeley, nothing's going to happen because it's such a liberal community. So we're starting to feel pretty good. But then as the year goes, it goes along. We start to see signs that there are going to be various forces against us. And, we organized a committee within the, within, the, our board and others, a kind of public relations committee to go out into the community and to talk to clergy and political leaders and media about the show that's coming to Cincinnati and what it's all about.

00;54;08;13 - 00;54;40;03
Dennis
And, we did actually, I think a very good job of getting a lot of public opinion behind us. In fact, even the Cincinnati Enquirer, which is not known for its liberal bias, did an editorial saying Cincinnati can handle this exhibition. But at the same time, there were groups out there. The most significant was citizens for,

00;54;40;05 - 00;54;42;11
Dennis
Well, now I'm forgetting their name. Credit union.

00;54;42;11 - 00;54;42;28
Skyler
Values.

00;54;43;03 - 00;55;21;15
Dennis
For a community. Thank you. Citizen. You know, you can't stand them. It's hard to remember them. Citizens for Community values. And this was an outgrowth of another group called citizens for Decent Literature that had been around for years. It, they were organized against the exhibition and trying to stop it and in many ways went to our board members, went to me and, you know, and we had all sorts of situations where we were bribed, where we were to not show the exhibition.

00;55;21;15 - 00;55;54;15
Dennis
They promised us money and that I wouldn't go to jail and all this other stuff. But suffice it to say that we persisted in the idea that we were going to do the exhibition. It was at that time it was like the holidays of that year of, 1989 that the CCV sent out letters which, including child pornography to 30,000 households in Cincinnati, including my own, by the way.

00;55;54;17 - 00;56;20;24
Dennis
And they showed images that were not Mapplethorpe images of children in sex acts. This is what this is absolutely true. And of course, that caused an uproar, but an uproar against us because it was interpreted that we were the ones bringing child pornography to Cincinnati. And so the whole world changed. We now knew that we were like in a complete battle.

00;56;20;27 - 00;56;39;16
Dennis
Our funding was being cut off from various organizations and corporations. And, we were in a serious battle, a serious battle, not just about the exhibition, but a serious battle as to whether the Contemporary Arts Center would survive.

00;56;39;18 - 00;56;50;25
Jordan
All right. Do you believe these reactions were primarily motivated by the exhibit's explicit content or by Mapplethorpe's focus on queer themes?

00;56;50;28 - 00;57;31;00
Dennis
I think, okay, so what motivated the controversy and the action of the CCV? The CCV is, you know, a very narrow Christian right wing organization, which, by the way, consumes a lot of pornography, which I find fascinating. But, I think it was mostly about the homosexuality. They used the excuse of the children, of which there were two images of children in the exhibition, but it was really about the fact that Mapplethorpe was gay, that a lot of the subjects were gay.

00;57;31;03 - 00;58;14;21
Dennis
And, and a lot of the models. And then there were, sexual acts between men in the exhibition. So I think was that I think it was homosexuality, you know, again, we'd come out of the AIDS there. So people were not that warm to the idea of a homosexual reality. And certainly in Cincinnati, which is a conservative city, and especially when, again, you get organizations that now are kind of inflaming the local, media and, and politicians and others, law enforcement.

00;58;14;24 - 00;58;22;21
Jordan
All right. How did the public's reaction affect the museum's board and staff? What measures did you take to prepare for the backlash?

00;58;22;24 - 00;58;51;07
Dennis
Well, the backlash, the public reaction. It was only a part of the public. So we should always get that straight, you know, because you can't condemn this whole city. In the end, it turned out to be rather remarkable. Okay, in a positive way. But yes, there was a negative reaction. Suddenly some of the media was, particularly the newspapers, were against us.

00;58;51;10 - 00;59;21;26
Dennis
And, you know, it was making the news literally every night. It was on the news. And, there was, you know, there were threats against us, threats, physical threats against us, against me, my children, the staff. So it was a very tense time. And by that time, reporters were gathering from all over the country, because it was seen as the great First Amendment battle.

00;59;21;26 - 00;59;59;25
Dennis
And at a time where things were moving about. Free speech was very controversial. Just like now. And, so suddenly we were inundated with reporters CNN, Time Magazine, New York Times, they were all in Cincinnati looking for a story. The, how did we prepare for it? We had a lot of lawyers, we had lawyers on the board, but we also, we decided we needed some First Amendment lawyers.

00;59;59;27 - 01;00;28;10
Dennis
That's when we hired Lou Sirkin and Mark Mezibov and, who were specialized in First Amendment issues, including working for Larry Flynt of hustler magazine. So, which I always think it's pretty funny. I think Lou still works for him. But, anyway, they, they had had experience with these kind of issues which our staff and our board lawyers had not, and they were very good.

01;00;28;12 - 01;00;58;09
Dennis
And so we already were in a kind of, proactive stance where we knew this was going to wind up in court and how could we keep it out in court, and how could we keep it from being a huge battle? Even with all those efforts, it wasn't enough. I mean, it was clear that the sheriff of Hamilton County, Simon Leis, was going to some way, shape or form prosecute us.

01;00;58;11 - 01;01;30;14
Dennis
And it looked like the police chief was going to do the same. There was a political pressure on them to go after us. And then you have to go back a step and remember Cincinnati's history of being a conservative town, and particularly when it came to matters of, of, material with sexual content. So they always prided the sheriff always prided that since they didn't have the, you know, pornographic stores or theaters.

01;01;30;14 - 01;01;57;09
Dennis
By the way, all you had to do was just cross the bridge into Kentucky, which is like, you know, but, 1000ft, and you could do anything you wanted sex, gamble, you know, whatever. But it was, you know, it was hypocritical. And that always bothered me as to how hypocritical it was. Nevertheless, we knew from the media that they were going to come after us.

01;01;57;12 - 01;01;59;06
Jordan
All right.

01;01;59;08 - 01;02;06;28
Skyler
Okay. Talking a little bit about some of the things that the museum did to prepare, like dropping out of the Fine arts fund.

01;02;07;01 - 01;02;08;26
Dennis
Oh, we didn't drop out. They kicked us out.

01;02;08;29 - 01;02;11;24
Skyler
Oh, they kicked you out? Yeah. Oh, I didn't know that.

01;02;11;24 - 01;02;13;28
Dennis
Yeah.

01;02;14;00 - 01;02;15;18
Jordan
Can you speak on that?

01;02;15;20 - 01;02;37;04
Dennis
Oh don't be naive. We they were afraid that the fine arts fund would be under complete attack, and they wouldn't be able to do their annual, you know, what do you call it, campaign to raise money. And so.

01;02;37;06 - 01;02;39;18
Skyler
Addressing Jordan, which direction?

01;02;39;21 - 01;02;40;24
Jordan
Just look at me.

01;02;40;24 - 01;03;14;08
Dennis
Yeah. Well, okay. So anyway the Fine Arts Fund was afraid it would not that the public sentiment was against them and that they would not be able to effectively do their annual campaign. And so they basically said you have to leave the fund and that we would figure out something later, but we didn't voluntarily leave the fund. They said, you're leaving the fund and that, but somehow they would make it up to us when everything died down.

01;03;14;10 - 01;03;46;02
Dennis
So there was the Fine Arts Fund, which was about a quarter of our budget. I think. And, you know, and then other sponsors, Central Trust Bank and I can't remember several others cut their funding to us. So we were in actually serious financial trouble. The good news is that our case had attracted national support. So we had support from Ford Foundation, from the Guggenheim Foundation, from the Warhol Foundation.

01;03;46;04 - 01;03;57;12
Dennis
I mean, it was quite honestly, if we hadn't gotten that outside funding, I'm not quite sure what we would have done. We even got money from Barbra Streisand.

01;03;57;15 - 01;04;03;01
Jordan
So that's awesome. How is that all right.

01;04;03;03 - 01;04;08;11
Jordan
Can you describe what it was like when the police showed up and how you and the guest responded?

01;04;08;13 - 01;04;33;13
Dennis
Yes. So let me go back a step to talk about the opening of the exhibition. There are two openings. Yeah. The there was an opening on our standard opening for our membership was a Friday night opening, and it was always a fun thing to do. Several hundred people would show up. By this time, this is the biggest thing ever happening in Cincinnati.

01;04;33;15 - 01;05;03;28
Dennis
And instead of our usual 2 or 3 400 people, we've got thousands of people outside. And it was this kind of freak snowstorm. It was April, March or whatever, April 5th. Right. And there's a snowstorm. People are freezing standing outside. But it had become a thing. You had to be at that opening. So these hundreds, maybe thousands of people come to the Friday night opening and it all goes very well.

01;05;03;28 - 01;05;28;03
Dennis
And, you know, we were relieved and and we actually, I remember we went across the street and had a few pops and then, so we were thinking we had dodged the bullet. Okay. So Saturday morning I got up and I put on a sweatshirt not thinking anything was going to happen and a pair of jeans and went down there.

01;05;28;03 - 01;05;57;08
Dennis
And it was Saturday, downtown Cincinnati is pretty quiet. And a couple of my staff were there or whatever, and then immediately began getting calls from a couple of the media reporters that the police, I remember one reporter said, the sheriff and the police chief are playing John Wayne, deciding who's going to arrest you.

01;05;57;10 - 01;06;35;14
Dennis
And I searched us. Pretty funny. And anyway, the long and short is, so called board members and called our lawyers. Okay. And by this time, there were probably about 20 or 30, media people outside the outside the, building. And we opened and shortly after we opened the the vice squad. Can you believe it? The vice squad, I mean, came two members of the vice squad came in and served the indictments, and there were already people in the gallery.

01;06;35;14 - 01;06;58;23
Dennis
I mean, we had been open for a while, and, they immediately said, they were very polite by the way, so Cincinnati, they were very polite and they said, and I had met them before. They said there will be no arrests, there will be no seizure of property. We are going to close the gallery and videotape all the photographs.

01;06;58;25 - 01;07;29;04
Dennis
And, everybody had to clear out. And then it became very tense because there were the people who had to leave the gallery. And then there were, and I know several hundred people in the atrium that leads then led to the contemporary Art center. The old building, became very, very tense, got very angry when a city councilman was there and he said we should call for more police because it looks like it's going to get violent.

01;07;29;06 - 01;07;49;07
Dennis
And, and, finally the councilman said you should go out and talk to the crowd, which I did, and said that there will be no I said basically what I just said. Now, there will be no arrests. They are not going to seize the photographs and that we will reopen. And don't you know, please don't hurt anybody.

01;07;49;07 - 01;08;19;20
Dennis
And same thing with the cops. And so they were in there for an hour or something like that. I can't remember. And then they left. The police left with their video tapes and the doors reopened and we stayed open. That day. And then we immediately that day went to the federal court to get an injunction, claiming rightfully that it was a First Amendment issue.

01;08;19;20 - 01;08;45;18
Dennis
So it was now a federal issue, not a local, not a, county issue. So and then we had a meeting of the board that night at someone's house where the sheriff threaten us to, that he would he would charge us every day we were open and, and, you know, for the whatever how many eight weeks we were to be open.

01;08;45;18 - 01;09;11;20
Dennis
That's a lot of charges. You'd go to jail for 50 years. I, I personally my indictment was two years in jail. And, and then they indicted the museum. I don't know how you indict a museum, but they indicted the museum, you know, for sexually explicit material and the use of children in, in it's not sexually explicit.

01;09;11;20 - 01;09;28;29
Dennis
It's another term. Maybe you two, maybe you remember it. It's. But anyway, pandering obscenity and the use of children in lewd materials or something like that. But two years in jail is not anything to laugh at.

01;09;29;01 - 01;09;41;14
Jordan
Yeah. What were some of the responses from people prior to the exhibits arrival? How about when they visited? How do people respond?

01;09;41;17 - 01;09;42;28
Dennis
You mean when they visit the. Yeah.

01;09;42;28 - 01;09;44;03
Jordan
When they actually saw it?

01;09;44;05 - 01;10;02;21
Dennis
Oh, yeah. I- you know it. Well, it became the thing, it became the thing to do to see the exhibit. I mean, we had something like 85,000 people come through the exhibit in the short time it was there. Now for the contemporary Art center, which gets, you know, like in those days, maybe got half that number in a whole year.

01;10;02;23 - 01;10;24;14
Dennis
This was like, you know, every, you know, everybody was coming in to see it. Celebrities were coming in to see it. I always laugh because Julia Child the chef came to see it. And, there was somebody making a movie, Gregory Hines and Robin Givens or something. They were both in town. They came, everybody had to see it.

01;10;24;16 - 01;10;52;11
Dennis
And, and so the response was mostly just curiosity, and nobody seemed to run out in horror that we did have to put up, a, a sign, a warning saying you had to be 18 or over by Ohio law. And the X portfolio, which was the most controversial of the of the images, was not in a everybody was going ohhh it's in a room where- it was in a separate gallery.

01;10;52;11 - 01;11;29;18
Dennis
But there were other works in there as well. And it wasn't that you had to be 18 to go in that gallery. You just had to be 18 to come in the museum. I think mostly people were- thought it was a beautiful show. My best story about that is that I've told it. I've told it a lot. William Buckley was a conservative journalist who was very famous from the 1960s through the 1990s and he was on television all the time, and he wrote for The Wall Street Journal and, probably the most important conservative in America at that time.

01;11;29;20 - 01;11;54;17
Dennis
And he had written two columns just blasting us, I mean, me personally and, and the museum and so forth. And one day he shows up in the gallery and we're like, I remember my assistant Jennifer was saying, Bill Buckley is in the gallery. And I'm thinking I have to go talk to him. And so I went up to him.

01;11;54;17 - 01;12;17;02
Dennis
I said, Mr. Buckley he was somebody it was at giving a speech somewhere. And he, he said, I said, Mr. Buckley, welcome to the contemporary Art center. And he said, I said, I'm Dennis Barrie. And he said, I know who you are, you know, just like that. And I said, why? He said, yeah. He said, I've written to columns about this exhibition.

01;12;17;04 - 01;12;42;05
Dennis
He goes, I know you have. So anyway, the long and short of it is he toured the exhibition with our curator, and he came back and I said, well, how did you like the show? And he said, gorgeous, just a fantastic exhibition. He said, but you're going to jail for 13 of the pictures. I said, we're only indicted for six of them, you know.

01;12;42;05 - 01;13;04;29
Dennis
And he said, well, I always kind of wondered which are the ones that offended him as much as the ones that were, you know, legally indicted for. They said, but don't worry, you'll be you'll be acquitted in the federal courts. So it was very interesting. I mean, that was the funniest. And also you thought, oh, do I have to go, you know, does this have to go all the way to the Supreme Court?

01;13;04;29 - 01;13;09;13
Dennis
People thought it would, but as we know it didn't.

01;13;09;15 - 01;13;19;03
Jordan
Have, can you walk me through your experience with the court process, especially the moment you won the case?

01;13;19;05 - 01;13;41;08
Dennis
Well, the court process is a miserable process because it takes up your whole life. No matter how good your lawyers are, you spend your whole life talking to lawyers and to public relations people. And, and, and it's very waring, there's no doubt about it, because we were, you know, the actual trial did not occur until October.

01;13;41;08 - 01;14;22;29
Dennis
And again, our indictments were in April. So you got months and months of legal maneuvering, which we did to we tried all sorts of ways to get the case, really, you know, dismissed. The judge ruled that we weren't a museum because we didn't collect things. I mean, it was one thing after another. So it was very waring. It was interesting that as we when we finally went to trial, the selection of the jurors, to me was the most fascinating part of the trial, because in a jury trial, you have the right to refuse.

01;14;22;29 - 01;14;56;00
Dennis
The prosecution has the right, defense has the right, to refuse certain jurors, based on their biases or their background or the color of their hair. I mean, you know, it's all sorts of stuff. I was sitting there while there during the voir dire, as they call it, and in the courtroom. And there were two report- they were interviewing for the jury, and there were these two reporters sitting right behind me, and they were making bets on how soon we would be convicted.

01;14;56;03 - 01;15;21;14
Dennis
And I turned around and I said, come on, you know, I mean, it was so bad. Everybody was sure we would be convicted because the jurors and here's the most interesting part to me of the trial, the jurors were people, except for one that finally got selected, that had any real interaction with cultural, institutions and organizations in Cincinnati.

01;15;21;14 - 01;15;51;03
Dennis
They were mostly people from the outskirts of Hamilton County. And it's just in their normal lives they just didn't go to the art museum. They didn't go to the contemporary Art center. They didn't go to Cincinnati Ballet. They just didn't go. It doesn't mean they were against them. It just wasn't part of their life. I think one woman had actually gone to the contemporary Art center before, so it looked like these were the kind of people that would just say, oh, the pictures are horrible.

01;15;51;03 - 01;16;18;23
Dennis
And this elite museum is showing stuff like this and ruining our children and doing it. But, in the course of the trial, the prosecution did not put up a very good case. That's one thing. Number two, we had a very good case that it was protected speech. And, and so our witnesses and our attorneys did a great job of that.

01;16;18;23 - 01;16;47;25
Dennis
I testified, and, you know, I, I, we felt it was going very well. There was one funny moment. It's still the funniest moment of the trial where Lou or Mark, Lou Sirkin or Mark Mezibov, they knew the judge was an old prosecutor and, Albanese was his name. And prosecutors love to go to the scene of the crime.

01;16;47;27 - 01;17;16;24
Dennis
Okay. They love to see where the dead body is on the chalk, you know, chalk on the floor. And so they said to the judge, don't you think it's important that the jurors see the scene of the crime? And he said, yes. And so he loaded up the bus with the jurors and the prosecutor and my lawyers and me and the bailiff in one bus.

01;17;16;24 - 01;17;38;16
Dennis
And then there were all these reporters in another and this kind of parade going down the streets of downtown Cincinnati. And we went to the Contemporary Arts Center. But the bailiff said to the jurors that they could stand in the entrance way, but they could not raise their heads. Look at any art on the wall, because this would prejudice them.

01;17;38;18 - 01;18;01;18
Dennis
So they, so the the best thing was and Lou knew this and Mark knew this is that, you know, the prosecution was trying to present us as some porno store in an alley, you know, selling bad stuff to 12 year olds. And, you know, here's a Contemporary Arts Center. It's a museum, you know? And anyway, that trip was hilarious.

01;18;01;18 - 01;18;27;24
Dennis
And we all went back to the courtroom. No, but your were concerned, I mean, you know, a trial is a trial, and, we. The testimony ended on a Friday, and we thought they would not reconvene until Monday. And so, mayor, my staff and I went back to the Contemporary Arts Center, and then we got a call.

01;18;27;24 - 01;18;53;12
Dennis
It was like two hours later saying they were reconvening. So we were all kind of shocked. And we literally ran back to the courtroom. And the verdict, as you know, was not guilty. Which was wonderful. I remember they announced the verdict at the Cincinnati Reds game, which I thought was pretty interesting. You know, it was a big deal.

01;18;53;16 - 01;19;17;16
Dennis
And you guys weren't even born. It was absolutely a big deal in the city. The whole city was torn by one way or the other. And so, you know, it was very exciting. I remember getting drunk that night. I remember being on Jerry Springer was on, the legendary Jerry Springer, you know was a newscaster in Cincinnati.

01;19;17;19 - 01;20;03;18
Dennis
And he when they had interviewed me at the at the 11:00 news. And by then I was completely wasted and did some, you know, live interview out of standing in a parking garage or something downtown. But it was it was great. It was really, really great. And we were all relieved. And so one last story about the jurors, because I think they are the people, after the trial was over, I got a call from three of the jurors and they said they were really upset that the judge would not let them really see the Contemporary Arts Center.

01;20;03;20 - 01;20;31;26
Dennis
And could they come down and see the Contemporary Arts Center and, and meet, you know, say hello to me. And I said, sure. And so they came down and there are two women and one man, and, they gave me their impressions of the trial, and they felt the trial. They thought that the two images of the children were ridiculous to be even considered for a trial.

01;20;31;27 - 01;20;51;29
Dennis
By the way, both parents had given permission of their children for Robert to shoot the photographs. And they were angered that the judge would not let them see all of the images. They had to leave the room when all the images were shown. So they did see. They saw most of them, but they didn't see all of them.

01;20;52;02 - 01;21;12;26
Dennis
And then they found the whole thing ridiculous when they could not raise their heads to look at what was had, I don't even know what we had on the walls. But it's we're not allowed to look at the art on the wall. So that was it was really kind of wonderful to meet them. I never seen them since, but they were they were kind of average people.

01;21;12;28 - 01;21;16;12
Dennis
But whatever an average person is.

01;21;16;15 - 01;21;24;18
Jordan
Yeah. Why didn't you or the, CAC ever back down during the case?

01;21;24;20 - 01;21;57;10
Dennis
You can't back down for principle. I mean, First Amendment is a very important principle. I mean, we back down a lot, particularly now. I find it terrible, but when a- when a museum decides that the work is of value or an organization doesn't have to be a museum, it could be a big orchestra, you know, a theater or whatever, when they when that organization decides that it has artistic merit and social value and that's the decision they make.

01;21;57;10 - 01;22;24;20
Dennis
They have a right to present it. You have a right not to go. You have a right to say it's lousy, but you don't have a right to close it down and arrest the people involved. And that was the principle. And we all we knew that if they closed that, just like the Cor- Corcoran did it voluntarily. If they did it legally, closed us down then every art museum in the country was that vulnerable to police action.

01;22;24;22 - 01;22;45;00
Dennis
This is you know, this is like this is not Russia, this is China, this is this, you know, maybe it is now, but it, but the idea was that, you know, you have certain rights and the First Amendment was a very important right. So that was the reason we didn't back down. And it was not an easy decision.

01;22;45;03 - 01;23;14;12
Dennis
As you know, some of our board members were totally harassed in their personal lives and our staff the same way. My family was totally harassed, not by everybody, again, but by certain character, the characters that always call you up, by the characters that always, you know, most people in Cincinnati were were very supportive or not or not threatening in any way.

01;23;14;15 - 01;23;37;21
Dennis
My kids went to school, their teachers were fine. Our friends were fine. You know, we'd go out to dinner and people would come up and talk to us. The problem was everybody just wanted to talk to us all the time. And you didn't want to talk to them? After a while, you just wanted to watch the bad movie or whatever movie you were watching.

01;23;37;23 - 01;23;46;08
Jordan
What did winning the case mean for the CAC and for Cincinnati? Do you think it marked a shift in the local art scene or public perception?

01;23;46;10 - 01;24;19;18
Dennis
I think winning the case was a great moment. Okay. I don't think it was a lasting moment. I think that, you know, it was, not just the art world or the cultural world, but I think Cincinnati in many Cincinnatians were proud of themselves for saying we you know, we're not the kind of narrow minded city that, you know, they that often was the view of Cincinnati nationally.

01;24;19;20 - 01;24;41;08
Dennis
And so I think people were proud. I think as time wore on and I always say people better get back to their lives. I mean, you can fight a battle for so long, but eventually you want to just go home and have dinner and, our board got very weary of this was all everybody wanted to discuss.

01;24;41;08 - 01;25;11;07
Dennis
Our staff, they were exhausted. I was exhausted, and the art community and, general community wanted to get back to being to forgetting the controversy. Quite frankly. And so, you know, by early 1991, it was, it was clear that, people just wanted to be back to normal. And I felt quite, quite honestly, out of place.

01;25;11;07 - 01;25;47;24
Dennis
By that time, I knew I'd burn my bridges and, I was like the focus of the controversy. And I think that made people uncomfortable. So, and what longtime happened is, you know. Nobody did anything controversial after that for quite a while. But I don't even know what would have been controversial. I mean, in the wake of Mapplethorpe, CAC kept doing their show, Contemporary Arts center, kept doing their shows.

01;25;47;27 - 01;26;10;24
Dennis
I left in the spring of 1991, so not very short. Pretty shortly after the after the trial, you know, and I was happy to leave and they were happy to see me leave, how's that? Yeah. It it was hard for people.

01;26;10;27 - 01;26;19;28
Jordan
How did this controversy impact the art considered to be included in museums? How about artists who are considered to be on the edge of acceptable art?

01;26;20;04 - 01;26;53;27
Dennis
Okay. How did it affect the art community? It affected it first positively and then negatively. Okay. In that, the trial to prosecute the prosecution of the Contemporary Arts Center and me and the trial really scared the art community nationally. And so even though we won the it, there was a real pullback to do anything very controversial, I'd say for almost ten years.

01;26;53;29 - 01;27;21;20
Dennis
And it- art museums didn't take any chances and so forth. It was it was really kind of sad but not unexpected. I think like the next controversy was, you know, at the Smithsonian or when Giuliani tried to pull the plug at the Brooklyn Museum, and I can't remember the artist's name, the African artists who had died, the image of the Virgin with,

01;27;21;22 - 01;27;45;27
Dennis
Animal dong on it. I just can't remember his name, so. But that was like ten years later, eight or 9 or 10 years later. So nothing much went on, you know, it kind of calmed down, but there wasn't much that was controversial. So, and I think that was too bad. I. Yeah. You know, we're kind of in a similar period.

01;27;46;00 - 01;28;17;20
Dennis
Okay. We're in a similar period now where risk taking really is risk taking. And you, you, artwork is politically, challenging these days. I mean, not every art, you can paint a flower, and it's fine, but if you paint a image of, you know that it has some political or social content to it or racial content, it can be very challenging right now.

01;28;17;20 - 01;28;50;26
Dennis
It can be very controversial. So artists, artists, you know, I don't say. Yeah, when you were talking, it's not particularly about gay art or anything like that. It's about the issues that the society sees right now. And, yeah. I've never been like a year or two ago, they were closing. They were protesting, closing down museums and directors were being fired and or had to quit. The Whitney because they showed an image of Emmett Till.

01;28;50;28 - 01;29;15;25
Dennis
You know, Emmett Till was the black man murdered? The image was painted by a white girl, actually a girl here, a girl, a woman here from Cleveland. You know, so there's that kind of there's a kind of social, political thing going on in our whole country. Campuses. Look at it, campuses were torn apart last year, and there actually just recently torn apart here.

01;29;15;27 - 01;29;33;22
Dennis
So there's that. So artists who are on the edge, they're still there, lots of artists who are great and interesting and difficult things, but oftentimes they're confronted with, a challenging climate.

01;29;33;24 - 01;29;42;10
Jordan
All right. Given the context of the Mapplethorpe case, is there still a fight against censorship that needs to be fought today?

01;29;42;12 - 01;30;22;06
Dennis
Oh, there's always a fight against censorship that needs to be fought. I think what's interesting is it's going to shift from. But I think what's interesting is how censorship shifts. Okay. And so censorship in the 80s and 90s was mostly from the right. Okay. Very right wing political groups, Christian right organizations, those sorts of things. Right wing politicians, and lately the, the, censorship is often come from the left about what images you can show.

01;30;22;09 - 01;30;48;14
Dennis
Okay. Again racial or whatever. So it's always there. You know, in a free society, I always think of a free society you don't have to go. You don't have to look at it. You know, I mean, this is it's a decision made by the individual, okay? If you hated what the Contemporary Arts Center is showing, don't go.

01;30;48;16 - 01;31;24;16
Dennis
You know, if you don't like what the Cincinnati Playhouse is presenting because it's a play with men kissing, don't go, you know? And so that is, that is always there. And there's so much censorship right now. I mean, I think it's one of the darkest periods of censorship in our, in our, not in our history. There have been a lot of these moments, but certainly it's a difficult time to be, not just an artist to be anybody who wants to make a statement, you know, on campuses or whatever.

01;31;24;18 - 01;31;32;11
Dennis
It's pretty hard right now. It's why I don't do it. All right. What else do you need?

01;31;32;14 - 01;31;35;10
Jordan
Yes, I do you have any questions?

01;31;35;13 - 01;31;42;19
Skyler
Well, I always love when you talk about, how you just. You never work for a museum again until it's,

01;31;42;21 - 01;31;44;17
Dennis
It's a true story.

01;31;44;20 - 01;31;46;01
Skyler
Until the,

01;31;46;04 - 01;31;46;19
Dennis
Rock.

01;31;46;22 - 01;31;47;26
Jordan
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

01;31;47;26 - 01;31;56;19
Skyler
I love if you tell that story. I can tell that one.

01;31;56;21 - 01;32;15;25
Dennis
So it was pretty hard. It was. It was hard on me to think about staying in the art world. Okay? And I knew I wasn't going to get. I had I had planned, you know, your plan, your life in a certain way. And I thought that I had had offers even while I was at the contemporary arts.

01;32;16;00 - 01;32;42;25
Dennis
Even while I was on a trial to go to other art museums. Okay. But it was just too crazy. And I thought I couldn't I never want to be in a position where a lot of other people are deciding my fate, in this case the board of a museum, because that's what happens. Thank God our board was strong enough to stay with me.

01;32;42;28 - 01;33;12;12
Dennis
So I just said, I'm never going to work for another museum, I'm never going to work. And I freelanced, did some jobs, a good job out in Santa Fe, and, I had a job for Elvis. That's why there was an Elvis painting up there. I did a job for Graceland. And then I there was some reporter, I think he was from ABC nationally, and we just he was interviewing me and he said, would you ever work in a museum again?

01;33;12;12 - 01;33;43;03
Dennis
And I said, no, laughingly. I said, unless it was the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, you know, just as a joke. And I got a call less than a week later from the headhunter, from the, the, company looking for a possible director saying, would you interview for the job? I just laughed, I said, this is hilarious, you know, but I did an interview for the job because I loved the idea of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and and Museum, as it's called.

01;33;43;05 - 01;34;03;07
Dennis
And I interviewed and got the job and I loved doing it. I was there, I was the director. That got, basically shaped its form and got it opened. And it was a great project, is a great project. If you haven't read of the Rock Hall, you're missing one of the great museums in the country.

01;34;03;10 - 01;34;05;15
Jordan
I thought about moving here just to get in for free.

01;34;05;18 - 01;34;06;29
Dennis
Yeah.

01;34;07;01 - 01;34;37;01
Dennis
You know, it's so it's just, it was fun, but, I mean, and then it kind of led to. I mean, it's it's such an unusual place that it wasn't quite going back. It was still filled with controversy. Believe me. Rock music, rap music, it's all filled with controversy. But, it was great to do. And then, after I, I left the Rock Hall after three, three years and went to work for a man who had lots of money.

01;34;37;01 - 01;35;02;29
Dennis
And that's when we started building our own museums, which was kind of fun, too, you know? So I had the ability to build museums and had the money and the independence, and they actually didn't have to answer to anybody, which was really great. And that's when we, built the International Spy Museum in Washington, which was great fun and went on to do other museums after that.

01;35;03;02 - 01;35;09;07
Dennis
But I didn't have a board, and I didn't have to worry about sheriffs.

01;35;09;10 - 01;35;12;19
Jordan
Is there anything else you'd like to include that we didn't get to cover?

01;35;12;21 - 01;35;45;00
Dennis
I'm trying to think what, What is or isn't, is there? I think we've covered it pretty much. You know, I've done this so many times. Don't take it as a negative on this, but I have done it a lot. And, you know, things come back to you. You go, oh, I should have talked about that. Oh, I should have talked about, you know, so and so and, but I've heard, you know, it's a, it's a good bad story and it's, the Contemporary Arts Center is thriving.

01;35;45;04 - 01;36;11;27
Dennis
I mean, I, I, you know, I love the new building. It's too big. I went back for the, 20th anniversary last year. I think it was last year, September of last year for the for the building at sixth and Walnut. And it was great seeing people again, you know, and I don't have any hard feelings about Cincinnati.

01;36;12;00 - 01;36;41;12
Dennis
My kids grew up there, you know, they love it. It was fun. It was fun. And it's, I think on a positive side with Cincin- I did have it did eventually it did loosen up to a, to a degree. I remember being out with a couple of my dear friends who are still there, and we were over the ride and again over the Rhine at one time, and still is in some places, you know, a sketchy neighborhood.

01;36;41;15 - 01;37;03;22
Dennis
And I say, oh, I just love how it's developed. And they say, yeah, they do that. My friends were saying it's a much more open city, you know, it's much more forgiving or something like that. And I think it probably is now. So that made me feel good. You know, I don't want to live there, but I always said I moved to the free North.

01;37;03;25 - 01;37;38;05
Dennis
There is some truth in that. You know, I tell one last story. It's a Cincinnati story. And if you're talking about censorship, Harry Smith is was a is a reporter. I think he was last on NBC. He was on CBS and everything else and, nationally. And he, he was interviewing me in New York, and we were sitting there getting powder on our nose.

01;37;38;05 - 01;38;06;07
Dennis
He didn't give me makeup, by the way, but he said, putting powder on my nose and getting powder on his nose. And he said, Dennis. You know, I worked in Cincinnati for six months. And I said, you did? And then he goes, I said, well, why don't you live? And he said, Cincinnati. The German need to control coupled with Bible Belt fanaticism.

01;38;06;09 - 01;38;37;18
Dennis
And that's the image I had had in those days that it, you know, was a combination of these kind of social forces, this, you know, somebody call it the buckle of the Bible belt. Because it's not it's, it's as much a southern city as it is a midwestern city. And, that was when you lived there, you know, that, you know, and a people from afar.

01;38;37;18 - 01;39;07;20
Dennis
It's a lovely city. It's an absolutely lovely city. And I was happy to live there for a while. But he was right. It had those two backgrounds in it's history that made it the perfect place for the perfect moment. It made it the perfect place to have the battle over censorship, because it was when the various forces, both locally and nationally, looked at the exhibition and where it was go, and they went,

It won't get it won't be prosecuted in Berkeley, but it will. Cincinnati is the perfect place because of the kind of city it is, which is unfair, we all know, but nevertheless was the perception of the city. So it was the perfect place for the perfect moment. I go back every now and then, I sneak in.

01;39;35;08 - 01;39;51;12
Dennis
I sneak in. I go into the under cover of darkness, cross the Hamilton border line. Go see my friends in Hyde Park. Maybe over the rhine, oh God. 24 hours. They don't even know it's there. I'm only kidding. I think we're done.

01;39;51;14 - 01;39;52;09
Jordan
Done.

01;39;52;12 - 01;39;54;27
Skyler
I have one more thing. If you're willing, that I'd like to ask.

01;39;55;00 - 01;39;55;23
Dennis


01;39;56;12 - 01;40;04;26
Skyler
I would like if you could talk about how, it affected the art center afterwards, how, the memberships increased, how more people knew about it and came to it just really.

01;40;04;26 - 01;40;37;19
Dennis
Yeah. Okay. I think the, controversy of the trial had, ultimately had a positive effect on the art, the Contemporary Arts Center. You know, for example, they were able to raise $38 million and build a wonderful new building downtown, and they had increased membership. And it's and I think it's profile in the community is even greater than it than it used to be.

01;40;37;21 - 01;41;06;01
Dennis
It was always sort of a place for outsiders, you know, it was like people ran the ad. That's how it sounds. But like on the edge, but on the cutting edge and maybe a little hipper than the art museum types or the symphony types. And I think now it's not mainstream, but it's certainly more, widely appreciated than, than it was when we fought that.

01;41;06;01 - 01;41;29;07
Dennis
So now it's a nice place. I'm just sorry they got rid of the cafe, right? The cafe. They had a cafe in the lobby. So, hey, you wouldn't have a 21 C hotel if there wasn't a contemporary art center. Let me tell you that. It wouldn't be hip enough to have a 21 C if you ever go to a 21 C.

01;41;29;09 - 01;41;30;21
Jordan
I've never been.

01;41;30;23 - 01;42;01;24
Dennis
And it's right there. And my, they have to get my streets right and all that. It's right next to the contemporary Art center, and it's, it's a hotel very small. Stay there a couple times. That has a great art collection. Very, very hip song by the family that that, distills Jack Daniels and Brown, the Brown family tobacco and alcohol.

01;42;01;26 - 01;42;03;22
Dennis
Cincinnati.

01;42;03;24 - 01;42;07;20
Jordan
Amen. Okay, okay. All right.

01;42;07;20 - 01;42;08;22
Jordan
That's all we need.

01;42;08;25 - 01;42;11;06
Dennis
I hope it works. So who else are you going to do?
