00:00:00:00 - 00:00:07:22
Jordan

00:00:07:22 - 00:00:16:23
Jordan
Ok rolling. Do you want me to get them both?

Jordan
All right. Would you mind spelling your name for us? Your first and last.

00:00:37:03 - 00:00:42:20
H. Louis Sirkin
I go by H. Louis. L-O-U-I-S. Sirkin. S-I-R-K-I-N.

00:00:42:22 - 00:00:49:19
Jordan
All right. And then can you give a short introduction to yourself? Your job title and your job title.

00:00:49:21 - 00:01:13:05
H. Louis Sirkin
Well, I'm of counsel of a law firm in Cincinnati called Santen and Hughes. Being senior counsel, I'm just kind of older and, not a partner, but I've been with that firm for 12 years. Prior to that, I had my own law firm and had been in practice, coming in a couple days, I'll be starting my 60th year of practice as a lawyer.

00:01:13:07 - 00:01:23:09
Jordan
All right. Congratulations. So how were you brought as a legal counsel to the contemporary Art center? When did that happen? And what prompted it?

00:01:23:09 - 00:01:49:23
H. Louis Sirkin
Well, it was it was probably the latter part of the fall of 1989 into 1990, the beginning of the year. I got contacted and myself and my partner, Mark Mezibov, both have done, had done a lot of First Amendment work prior to that. And, we got a call. We were both recommended, from members of the board.

00:01:50:01 - 00:02:20:02
H. Louis Sirkin
Decided to send Dennis Barrie over to come and talk to us about the upcoming exhibit that was coming to Cincinnati. We were aware of the controversy dealing with the Robert Mapplethorpe exhibit, because we were aware of what happened in Washington, D.C., with Senator Jesse Helms in the Corcoran Museum. And in anticipation of the exhibit coming to Cincinnati, there was a tremendous amount of controversy going on.

00:02:20:02 - 00:02:48:04
H. Louis Sirkin
It was very anti-bringing the exhibit to Cincinnati. I had, prior to that, been contacted by one of the television stations. You know, they came down and talked to to me about whether there would be a problem with the exhibit if it played in Cincinnati. And that and I, I put together a stack of obscenity cases that I thought the news individual ought to sit down and read before he started to comment about it.

00:02:48:06 - 00:03:11:22
H. Louis Sirkin
He never came to pick it up. And, after our short meeting with Dennis, we then met with the board who found out what their problem and concerns were. And then we later met with the board of trustees, and that's how we got it. And we came up with some ideas of how to try to change the web in the direction that was going on.

00:03:12:00 - 00:03:35:05
H. Louis Sirkin
And we were able to formulate an idea where we took an offensive stand with it and started to speak publicly that, look, this is a legitimate, you know, art facility. Although it was called an art gallery, it was really a member of the American Art Museum, you know, Museum Association in its director, Dennis Barrie had a Ph.D. in art history.

00:03:35:07 - 00:03:59:15
H. Louis Sirkin
So, I mean, he was a very legitimate, you know, director of a museum. And we thought it was very, you know, shocking kind of principle, that there would be difficulty in a contemporary art center bringing an exhibit to Cincinnati. And, our idea was to, as I say, to take an offensive move to try to change the publicity that was going on.

00:03:59:17 - 00:04:25:17
H. Louis Sirkin
And we ultimately came up with an idea to file an action for declaratory judgment. There's a provision in the Ohio statutes that provide that if something's coming or is going to be exhibited, that may potentially be obscene, you can file an action, to have, you know, have the situation looked at and have a determination of whether it is or is not obscene.

00:04:25:19 - 00:04:53:05
H. Louis Sirkin
And we figured with that, there'd be there was nothing to lose. If they found any portion of it a problem, it would give them, you know, the contemporary art center, the reason for removing certain photographs if they were a problem, because otherwise they could not remove anything. They had a contract with the University of Pennsylvania where the exhibit had originated, that said that you shall display this exhibit exactly, all the pictures.

00:04:53:07 - 00:05:21:07
H. Louis Sirkin
And if you wanted to do anything different, you had to get written permission. Obviously, the University of Pennsylvania said, no, you show it all. Or, you know, you'll be breaching the contract. The other thing that we were really, really worried about was, is that if they did, law enforcement took any action that there was a possibility that they would seize, certain of the photographs and then hold them as evidence.

00:05:21:09 - 00:05:42:02
H. Louis Sirkin
The originals. And the trial might not take place for six, eight, ten months. Not only would they not be available for the exhibit, they would not be available to send off to the next city because the show was aâ€“ the exhibit was a traveling exhibit, which meant that it was going to play in various different facilities throughout the country.

00:05:42:04 - 00:06:12:09
H. Louis Sirkin
I think the show opened, I think, in Chicago. Then it moved to the Washington, D.C. then it went out west, and then from Cincinnati it was to go to Boston. And so there was concern about whether, you know, they'd be able to comply with the contractual provision. So we came up with this idea, we made a decision to file it in the lowest court. Our court system is divided by you have what's called county courts, which are small.

00:06:12:12 - 00:06:44:09
H. Louis Sirkin
You know, it take a particular area. But you have municipal courts, and municipal courts can handle civil cases up to $1500 or $2500 and criminal cases that are misdemeanors. They don't handle felonies. And then you have the Common Pleas Court, which is what we define as a general jurisdiction court where they can handle felonies. They can also handle misdemeanors, and they also can handle, you know, what would be called injunctive proceedings.

00:06:44:11 - 00:07:21:03
H. Louis Sirkin
And our concern was that if we filed the lawsuit in the Common Pleas court, that would give an opportunity for the law enforcement to come back and cross claim our action for what we called for, and making a claim that presenting an obscene performance or exhibit could constitute a nuisance. And if it becomes, it's declared a nuisance, they can shut down the property for a year, unless you post a bond in the value of the building, and you can be fined up to only a couple hundred dollars.

00:07:21:05 - 00:07:56:21
H. Louis Sirkin
But you can also be getting, you know, an injunction can be granted against you. So we were concerned that if we filed our declaratory judgment action in the Common Pleas Court, that they could cross claim that nuisance. Now, one advantage of the declaratory judgment section was, is that if an action to declaratory judgment was pending, then if law enforcement brought criminal charges or civil charges against the Contemporary Arts Center, they could not proceed while the declaratory judgment action was pending.

00:07:56:23 - 00:08:21:08
H. Louis Sirkin
So we did some research, or I did some research, and I discovered that our municipal court, there were only two municipal courts in the state of Ohio that have injunctive power. One is Cleveland and one is Columbus. And the injunctive, a power that they have, only relates to housing claims. And so that it would not be. But our court did.

00:08:21:08 - 00:08:41:00
H. Louis Sirkin
Have had power for declaratory judgment, but they did not have jurisdiction. If the law enforcement or the county decided to try to file a nuisance against us, they couldn't do it in that court. And if they did it in the other court by the statute, it would be stay and they wouldn't be able to go forward with it.

00:08:41:02 - 00:09:07:03
H. Louis Sirkin
So we figured we'd have them locked in. So we wouldn't have this fear. So we put together a lawsuit and we filed it in. And our hope was we'd invited all the law enforcement agencies, the sheriff's department and the prosecutor's office when the exhibit was, you know, put together. And it was put up and in the museum. Come on down and take a look at it and tell us if there's any problems.

00:09:07:06 - 00:09:32:14
H. Louis Sirkin
We don't think there is. And, I think the sheriff's department did come down. They took some photographs. They really liked the show and the exhibit, and we could never get the prosecutor's office to come over. They refused to do that, but we felt, and then once we filed the declaratory judgment action, we started to come out publicly and say, hey, look, we're not afraid of this.

00:09:32:14 - 00:09:57:00
H. Louis Sirkin
Let's get this decided. And by the way, generally what we call a declaratory judgment action, you wouldn't be entitled to a trial by jury, but you could ask for an advisory jury where they come and they can, you know, the judge wouldn't be bound by it. We said, we're so sure that this exhibit is not a problem that we would like to have an advisory jury and let's go play it out.

00:09:57:00 - 00:10:27:04
H. Louis Sirkin
Let's see what happens. So we filed it. And while all this was going on, we were having public appearances and we were making the claim that it was no problem. And the day, the day that the show was to open, we had filed the lawsuit. The city filed a motion to dismiss it, because it the county once they brought it later on, once they brought indictments, they kicked the prosecution to the city of Cincinnati because it was only a misdemeanor.

00:10:27:10 - 00:10:51:23
H. Louis Sirkin
And it occurred within the city. So they kind of copped out of it. They got, you know, all this kind of attention and threats and everything. They filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that the court didn't have jurisdiction. They shouldn't hear it, the declaratory judgment action. And the Friday that the show was to open that day, we had a hearing and we were really disappoint, at what happened

00:10:51:23 - 00:11:14:15
H. Louis Sirkin
With that. We appeared and we were all ready to argue. The judge called us into chambers, both sides. And and his comment was, is that can't you guys work this out? It's only a matter. What's the difference if the a couple pictures, how many pictures are really a problem in the city at that point? Or the county said, well, there may be 15 pictures that might be a problem.

00:11:14:17 - 00:11:33:07
H. Louis Sirkin
And he said, why don't you just take them down? I said, judge, we can't. There's a contract. And if we do that, we're in breach of it and we're not going to do it. That would be terrible for the museum. And he said, okay, let's kick it out. So we get out there and we make our argument in state called us all kinds of names. That

00:11:33:07 - 00:12:03:00
H. Louis Sirkin
we were using the city of being Neanderthal people and, and all that kind of stuff there, you know, that trying and making allegations that Cincinnati was backwards. You know, all that. And to our really deep surprise, the judge granted their motion to dismiss. Yeah. I mean, we were you know, we were all really psyched up for this great experience. And now, you know, within hours, there was going to be the preview of the exhibit at the contemporary Arts Center

00:12:03:02 - 00:12:24:09
H. Louis Sirkin
to people who were members of the in, you know, the museum. And, it was I think they were going to the show was going to be from they were going to be allowed in from like 7 to 10. And here this was about 3:00 in the afternoon. And we were really worried. And everybody was saying, why don't you run to federal court and get an injunction?

00:12:24:10 - 00:12:43:12
H. Louis Sirkin
Well, the problem was we could never get a commitment out of the city or the county that if the exhibit opened, that they would bring a prosecution. They kept saying, we don't know what we'll do. We don't know what the show shows. And until it opens, we can't do anything. So we didn't have enough. You got to have a reason you got to have what

00:12:43:15 - 00:13:09:14
H. Louis Sirkin
we call standing. You know, you have to be sure you can't just say, well, we think we might be have a problem. So that night, the exhibit opened to the members of the contemporary Art center in that exhibit drew over 8000 people. And I don't know if you're familiar with downtown, but the Contemporary Arts center, the federal courthouse is right here and right across

00:13:09:16 - 00:13:43:15
H. Louis Sirkin
the Where the busses go across that block on Government Square is where the Contemporary Arts Center was. In that building, and it was really interesting because there was a big banner hanging from the federal building. There was [unintelligible], the 200th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. And so all this kind of free speech stuff going on at that time, the people were actually lined all the way around the block, all the way up Fifth Street and around downtown it and back up, fourth Street and the exhibit.

00:13:43:15 - 00:14:04:17
H. Louis Sirkin
And, I mean, we were all excited. It was all terrific, but we were still worried. The show was to open at 9:00 Saturday morning, and my partner and I went down to the office and we didn't go over to the CAC, and we just kind of hung around because we were worried what would happen once it opened. In a about, you know. Things were going smoothly, we thought.

00:14:04:19 - 00:14:34:03
H. Louis Sirkin
And probably about 10:00, 10:30, I received a call from one of our judges, who was what they call, the duty judge it was there to receive indictments. And he told me that they, you know, the state, the county had just gotten an indictment. The charge five of the photographs were for being obscene. And there were two pictures of two children, that were, one where the boy was naked.

00:14:34:03 - 00:14:59:19
H. Louis Sirkin
He was probably, I would say, maybe 5 or 6 years old, standing on a couch. And ultimately we learned that that picture was requested by the boy's mother. She it was a friend of Robert Mapplethorpe, and it asked him to come over. She wanted to take a series of pictures of her, of her son. And he had just come out of a shower and he was running around.

00:14:59:19 - 00:15:11:15
H. Louis Sirkin
It was New York flat, and he took some pictures. And so one of them was he was standing on a couch and he was nude. That was one picture. And then there was another picture and I forgotten her name.

00:15:11:17 - 00:15:12:17
Jordan
I think it's Rosie.

00:15:12:20 - 00:15:35:06
H. Louis Sirkin
Rosie. Yeah. Was a picture that Robert had taken when he was in London. He had gone to London to attend a friend's wedding, and he had stayed with the family. Rosie's family, and that. And that morning of the the wedding, she was sitting on the porch and or on the step on the porch and using a skirt. And he took a picture of that.

00:15:35:08 - 00:15:58:06
H. Louis Sirkin
So those two pictures were charged with being exhibiting, the nude photograph of a child. Now, you know, a photograph of a nude child is in and of itself is not a crime. It only becomes a crime if it if it shows a lewd and lecivious depiction of the child in a naked state. And these were two very innocent pictures.

00:15:58:12 - 00:16:19:05
H. Louis Sirkin
They had nothing to do with anything surrounding it, in anything at all to do with sexuality. I mean, it was just like, you know, millions of pictures are taken every day by parents and their kids coming out of the bathtub or whatever. I mean, they're just simply not taken to be erotic or anything like that. But they charged it.

00:16:19:10 - 00:16:41:17
H. Louis Sirkin
And we were a little, you know, we were surprised that they did. Someone who had once made a comment that the picture of Rosie, you know, her eyes were like wide open and so on. And I don't know if you all remember as children there was a famous photographer or artist, you know, called Keane paintings and, you know, children to be on the yacht and said, oh, no.

00:16:41:17 - 00:17:27:06
H. Louis Sirkin
And then somebody said, look like you could see the fright in her eyes. It was absolutely ridiculous. Absolutely no different than, you know, one of those Keane things and so on. But they charge those two pictures now there was said. So there were two counts. The one count involved five pictures, which were part of the exhibit was made up of three various phases of Robert Mapplethorpe's live the early years in the early 70s when he was just really getting started in photography, and he was very much of the sexual generation that the 70s really was and had taken pictures that were done, you know, that were taken in a, you know, the homosexual

00:17:27:06 - 00:17:58:20
H. Louis Sirkin
area, erotic. And some of them were erotic, some of them were not. And they were five and they were they were laid out in three rows and would show contrast. The top row was some of those erotic type pictures. The second level was the. Robert was fascinated with the structure of the Callalily plant, and the second one was, a row of that and on the bottom were a continuation of the next, like the x part.

00:17:58:22 - 00:18:20:01
H. Louis Sirkin
And they were like on a what would you call a library table top. You know, it was a cross and it was kind of slanted. And in order to, to make sure that we didn't get into a lot of controversy, they moved that that set of pictures, you know, in that form into a separate room. And then they had other pictures where around.

00:18:20:01 - 00:18:51:02
H. Louis Sirkin
But he, he had worked on portraits like that in the early years. And then later in the later part of his career, he did a lot of, you know, a lot of photographs of people, of well known people. Like Donald Sutherland was one, and I can't or many other people that that he had. And then he had some pictures that were, you know, that I think brought some of the controversy that was involved were pictures of African American men with white women.

00:18:51:04 - 00:19:17:18
H. Louis Sirkin
And I mean, just well done photographs. But I think that brought some stir and, you know, and it was all balanced them in 169 photographs that were consistent in the exhibit. And they, so the judge, so I got the call from the judge and he said that they just had returned an indictment like that, and that they'd probably be serving it within the next half hour or so.

00:19:17:18 - 00:19:41:04
H. Louis Sirkin
So Mark and I ran down to the to the CAC, which was about four blocks from our office, and shortly after we got there, we were waiting. We kept waiting for the police to come down, and we sent spies up to the courthouse to see what was going on. And the police officers had stopped. There was a coffee shop, about a block away from the courthouse.

00:19:41:04 - 00:20:16:10
H. Louis Sirkin
They all stopped to have lunch before they came down, and then they came down. And we learned that some of the early patrons to the exhibit were members of a grand jury. They had in advance, had put together and called in people as the grand jury. We later also learned that they alerted a municipal court judge, to be available to come to their office on that Saturday morning, that they would probably need her and they wanted her to sign a search warrant, which she did.

00:20:16:12 - 00:20:45:13
H. Louis Sirkin
And due to the publicity that we had created before the exhibit opened, about prior restraint. I mean, one of the most important issues dealing with the First Amendment is you have the right to speak. You may be responsible for what you say, but you got an absolute right of free expression. And so if you cut somebody off, or if you take a picture down and don't let anybody look at it, it's a prior restraint.

00:20:45:15 - 00:21:19:18
H. Louis Sirkin
So she and knowing that she was being called judge Marsh, she did a lot of research on her own. And she was very, very concerned about her prior restraint. And she refused to allow law enforcement to take any picture down from the exhibit. She allowed them to videotape it or take photographs, which created a problem, actually, for the trial, because people would be making a declaration of the artistic value in these pictures, not in their original form, but only a photograph of the original.

00:21:19:20 - 00:21:41:17
H. Louis Sirkin
But at any rate, she did not let them take any of the photographs or any of those off the walls. So they finally came. They came in mass. And, you know, you all have seen the pictures that that came about. And there were people outside protesting because they made them empty. The, you know, everybody that was a visitor or patron had to leave.

00:21:41:17 - 00:22:14:00
H. Louis Sirkin
And they went down. It was kind of a a lobby area of the building that the CAC was in. They were screaming and yelling and they were they had posters and the national news was all over the place with it. And, you know, they charged and I mean, the excitement that created nationally was is it, you know, they there was a big controversy when it opened in Washington at the Corcoran, but the Corcoran never showed the exhibit because of the claim that, you know, that they were there was made there.

00:22:14:02 - 00:22:37:15
H. Louis Sirkin
The Corcoran decided not to play the exhibit, and it moved down to the Washington Museum, which was several blocks away from the Corcoran. And, you know, the other thing that was a problem and created some concern for the CAC was the fact that the Corcoran really took a lot of flack. Here they are an artistic facility, a museum, and they're not protecting the artists.

00:22:37:15 - 00:23:19:18
H. Louis Sirkin
They copped out, you know, the fear. And they didn't want to do that here. So and then that started the story of it all. We were there and then what happened? Fortunately, the prosecutor's office decided to have their press conference, and they announced publicly the, you know, the charges that had been brought. And they gave us the basis of perhaps running the federal court to try to get a restraining order that in part of the press conference that they made was that they were asked what happens if the contemporary Arts Center continues to show the exhibit as a whole?

00:23:19:20 - 00:23:41:18
H. Louis Sirkin
Prosecutor made the comment, well, if they do that, then perhaps we'll even have to go ahead and not only try. And, you know, we've charged the director of the museum. We'll have to charge members of their board of trustees. And on that threat and the possibility of going after the trustees, we were able to put together a claim.

00:23:41:18 - 00:24:06:02
H. Louis Sirkin
And a federal lawsuit claiming a violation of potential First Amendment rights and the prior restraint we had earlier in the week, when the exhibit was going to open it had contact with a federal district court here saying that if we needed you, I is the court available over the weekend, the show's to start on Saturday morning?

00:24:06:04 - 00:24:32:21
H. Louis Sirkin
And I mean, interestingly enough, Judge Carl Rubin, who was the presiding judge here then, happened to live, yeah, it's really funny. My partner and I lived a street apart, and second, it was Ridge Road and Pleasant Ridge Amberly. And I lived on this side and Mark lived on this side, and Carl Rubin lived right almost in the middle, with this.

00:24:32:21 - 00:24:58:12
H. Louis Sirkin
And he told us that, he made arrangements. He said he's available. And just call him. He gave us his for our this phone number. And by late Saturday evening, we had had we put together a 1983 lawsuit and we went to Judge Rubin's house. We advised the city that we were filing the lawsuit and that they should be ready, and we were going to ask for a temporary restraining order.

00:24:58:14 - 00:25:23:10
H. Louis Sirkin
And Judge Rubin had already made arrangements with the UC Law School to allow their facility to be used for the hearing. And I believe it was Palm Sunday. When was the next day? And the reason we had to couldn't do it at the Federal Building. They were doing some type of work on the federal building that weekend, and so it wasn't open to the public.

00:25:23:16 - 00:25:51:10
H. Louis Sirkin
So we had a hearing on Palm Sunday, and the judge granted us an injunction, primary injunction. And he said the only time law enforcement or anybody affiliated with law enforcement were entitled to come into the CAC during the exhibition, and the exhibit would be, if we called them, they were prohibited from interfering at all with it. And he no.

00:25:51:11 - 00:25:59:17
H. Louis Sirkin
Hey. So that was great. I mean, we got just great press with that. And and then, what happened is they did come.

00:25:59:21 - 00:26:00:23
Jordan
Yeah, yeah.

00:26:01:01 - 00:26:03:17
H. Louis Sirkin
I have two protection notes.

00:26:03:19 - 00:26:20:22
Jordan
Can you sing it? It was really good. So we can. They are. I can hear that stuff. When we take it back up, we can pick up with the charges. Yeah. Just what they were like specifically, and.

00:26:21:00 - 00:26:23:03
H. Louis Sirkin
Well, they were the first. There were two counts.

00:26:23:05 - 00:26:32:06
Jordan
Oh. One second. I want to make sure that they're ready. You're so good. You're going again? Yep.

00:26:32:08 - 00:27:10:19
H. Louis Sirkin
Yeah. There were two charges brought. One was count one was that, you know,there wer five pictures that they were arguing were obscene. And then the two pictures of the children. But each one of those could constitute a separate crime because they individually and, you know, the legal process started, that the way they do it is they at that time has to have little balls, you know, like a throwaway thing, like you get when you go to a, place where they're playing what is it, a bingo?

00:27:10:21 - 00:27:35:18
H. Louis Sirkin
Yes. Circle it in each. We have 15 municipal court judges, and, you know, they pick one out of the hat. Well, the judge that they picked out of hat there and I went to watch the roll to make sure that it was all legit. No problem with it. We drew a judge, a guy who had gone to law school with our sheriff and, he had worked our sheriff at one time.

00:27:35:18 - 00:28:00:00
H. Louis Sirkin
He'd been our prosecutor in the county, and was very anti-porn and the judge got the case had, you know, had worked for him in the prosecutor's office for a number of years before he got moved up to the municipal bench. And it was like you have all the draws to get. So we got him in. He then had the first court appearance before him. When

00:28:00:00 - 00:28:34:13
H. Louis Sirkin
we entered our pleas of not guilty. He wanted the trial to be heard as quickly as possible. He wanted it. And we, of course, wanted to push it out because the exhibit would be in Cincinnati was only here for 30 days, and he wanted to see if we could try it within that 30 days. And we were able to rely on a criminal rule of practice that you can a person is entitled not to be tried in no less than 30 days after they've been arraigned, or they come before the court.

00:28:34:15 - 00:28:56:07
H. Louis Sirkin
We reminded the court of that that, you know, we were exercising that right, and by law, you can't try us any sooner than 30 days and the exhibit would perhaps be gone. So then I said, well, we can try it in the afternoon. And then we started with all kinds of motions, and, and, and, we lost every one of them.

00:28:56:07 - 00:29:28:12
H. Louis Sirkin
And the, this, the one that created the real concern for us and some problems. Generally in determining whether something is obscene. There are generally two definitions of obscenity. There's usually a state law that defines it. And then there's the federal law, which is we call Miller versus California, which created an absolute minimum of any law here. Could had to be in conformity of that.

00:29:28:14 - 00:29:58:20
H. Louis Sirkin
It could be less restrictive than Miller,b ut Miller was the absolute that the state could do and the three parts of the test are that taking the exhibit or the performance or movie, or the work and viewing it, the average person viewing that material as a whole would find that the material appeals to what is called the prurient interest in sex or nudity. Purient is defined as morbid or shameful.

00:29:58:22 - 00:30:32:23
H. Louis Sirkin
The second part of the test is the material apply. The average person in a community applying contemporary community standards would find that the depiction, which had to be a specified, defined sexual activity, was presented in a patently offensive manner. And the third part of the test is universal. It doesn't depend upon it, what the average community in the community believes. It was taking the material as a whole.

00:30:33:01 - 00:30:58:20
H. Louis Sirkin
It lacked serious artistic, political or scientific value. Well, I mean, it was a no brainer to us that this was an exhibit. The idea of the exhibit was to present for the first time, really to the world, that photography is an art form, no different than acting, no different than writing, no different than playing music. It was to be.

00:30:58:20 - 00:31:29:22
H. Louis Sirkin
And that's what that's why the exhibit was put together, was to portray it that the the brilliance of a photographer isn't necessarily the subject matter that he takes a photo of. It's the quality of the picture, how well he takes the picture. Is it centered? Right? Is the lighting all right, and that. And so how Janet Gordon, who put the exhibit together, wanted to show this to the world was to find the photographer.

00:31:30:00 - 00:31:55:18
H. Louis Sirkin
Whose work, she thought, was brilliant and she originally wanted to do with Andy Warhol, who was a well known photographer at that time. And unfortunately, just as she was getting ready to work on this project, he died, from pneumonia, which he got if after having had surgery and she was left with, oh my God, you know this is who I was going to do this with.

00:31:55:20 - 00:32:24:01
H. Louis Sirkin
And some New York, museum director, whatever had mentioned that he knew another young photographer that was really great and suggested Robert Robert Mapplethorpe. He was interested in it, but he insisted that he have some input as to what pictures would ultimately be displayed, and he wanted it and insisted that part of this X, Y, Z portfolio, that he had, be part of it because that was part of his career.

00:32:24:03 - 00:32:52:17
H. Louis Sirkin
A retrospective is a biography in a way, autobiography of you. But by you. But what you produced. So that's how that came about. And so to us it was I mean, here you got place recognized by the American Museum Association. There was a controversy in. Yeah, the Corcoran. But my God, it's in an art museum. And it, it, you know, it's being presented as art.

00:32:52:22 - 00:33:23:16
H. Louis Sirkin
Of course. The argument is, is that, well, you just can't say anything is art in art, you know, then that means anybody, all anybody has to do is I'm an artist and I'm showing this as an artist. So we were really, you know, that's where we really go. And prior to that for a number of years, I had been very much involved in representing the adult industry and, you know, adult bookstores and filmmakers and that and here, you know, we used to have really difficult times getting experts.

00:33:23:18 - 00:33:45:14
H. Louis Sirkin
But now with the museum on target, man we had experts from everywhere, every art museum anywhere, you know, I'll volunteer. And so that was, you know, we were going to really thrust on that and you had to take it as a whole. And we thought just as a a book, an autobiography would be the entire book, a retrospective would be the whole exhibit.

00:33:45:16 - 00:34:17:05
H. Louis Sirkin
You couldn't just take a page of a book and say, well, there's some description of sexual activity in this book. Therefore the book is, you know, in its entirety is obscene. Then the Miller test, our definition, the American definition of obscenity, really moved away from the definition of obscenity in England. In England, a single page, it's called the Hicklin case that, you know, if there's one page, make the whole the whole book a problem.

00:34:17:07 - 00:34:40:11
H. Louis Sirkin
But that wasn't the way it was to be here. And so, you know, and that's what we had always we always argued that there that look should be no question. And as a matter of fact, the law provided what we call an affirmative defense. If you are an art museum and this is presented for bona fide artistic reasons, you're exempt from prosecution.

00:34:40:13 - 00:35:00:13
H. Louis Sirkin
And we made that argument to the court saying hey you can't prosecutors we're in that. And the court said, oh, no, you're not a museum that relates to a museum because you would call yourself an art gallery. And if you're an art gallery, you don't have a permanent collection. You know, you just keep changing the show.

00:35:00:15 - 00:35:25:10
H. Louis Sirkin
A real museum has a permanent collection, and therefore you don't fit under the statute for that. And then he gave us the real shocker. And he said that this being an exhibit and it. Yeah. And it not an art exhibit that I as a patron can go in and I wouldn't necessarily go look at everything that's on display.

00:35:25:12 - 00:35:55:16
H. Louis Sirkin
I might just go look at a few pick you know, a few pictures that are on the wall. And he distinguished it from a book. He would say, you know, it's not like starting to read a book and you wouldn't know the whole story until you read the whole book. And this was you could just pick out I only want to look at these pictures and therefore he said that each of the pictures on their own would be judged according to the the Miller standard.

00:35:55:18 - 00:36:25:13
H. Louis Sirkin
And now, I mean, here you've got a picture of a man with his fist up his rectum, right? No. Had a had a bullwhip stuck in his, in his rear end. And there were other pictures that were sexually explicit in each one of them. Would be. And so but then, you know, my position was having dealt with materials that the idea of it was, is that we can still, you know, and then the board was like, oh my God, what are we going to do now?

00:36:25:13 - 00:36:49:04
H. Louis Sirkin
You know, it's not this whole thing that they come in and you can't defend it by all the others. And I said, well, you know, we just have to play it. And the whole picture in and of itself, forget the subject matter of it doesn't make any difference. The brilliance is how good the picture is. And that that's why it's called the perfect moment is clicking the camera at the exact moment.

00:36:49:04 - 00:37:31:04
H. Louis Sirkin
All the light and everything, and you get the most out of the picture. Well, that's really great, but jury's going to see. Not that original wonderful picture. They're going to see a copy of it. And so we had to make the adjustment for that which we were ultimately able to do. And you know, and then, you know, it's like the amazing thing is, is that the exhibit, drew over 80,000 people and I guarantee and everybody that was familiar with the contemporary art center that had been- that center had been around since the 1940s.

00:37:31:06 - 00:37:53:19
H. Louis Sirkin
And it was I mean, they brought in shows all the time, and if they drew 2000 people it was a lot. And, I mean, people came from everywhere to see it. And through. And then, you know, for the first 30 days of the show, there was just tremendous publicity. And then as the trial went along, we didn't have the trial to the fall.

00:37:53:21 - 00:38:24:21
H. Louis Sirkin
And, you know, at that point, I mean, it was just a from a lawyer's standpoint, it was a lot of pressure, for my partner and maybe because they, you know, it had so much worldwide attention. And once the charges got brought and it generated this kind of publicity, you know, lawyers, they considered themselves, First Amendment experts from New York and California and places like that were beginning to call the CAC.

00:38:24:23 - 00:38:49:10
H. Louis Sirkin
And we were constantly being asked, you guys feel that you can do it? And, you know, by that time, by 1990 I had probably tried already anywhere from 75 to 100 obscenity cases, not only in Cincinnati, but all over the kind of the Midwest and the South and the East Coast. And so I was familiar with the trials, and we knew what we were doing.

00:38:49:12 - 00:39:18:12
H. Louis Sirkin
And, we knew our Cincinnati audience. And so it was just it was great. And you had some fabulous. We learned, once the case got presented to the jury, they had absolutely no problem at all with the two pictures of the children. And the first, as we understand it, the first count, they the jurors, they said that in the jury itself, it was an eight person jury.

00:39:18:13 - 00:39:43:01
H. Louis Sirkin
The vote was 7 to 1 for acquittal on the obscenity issues. And finally the other guy they were outjust it was in a couple hours, which was surprising. My wife had come down to see the closing arguments. Yeah. The jury got the case probably around 3:00 in the afternoon, and my wife had to leave.

00:39:43:03 - 00:40:06:05
H. Louis Sirkin
She had the carpool, from my daughter's soccer team. My daughter was on soccer team at Walnut Hills. And Mary Lee had the duty to pick the kids up. Think, you know, by a group of 4 or 5 girls to take them home. And I said, look, go. It's going to be a while. And she actually heard the verdict on the news, and she didn't get to have the thrill of being there.

00:40:06:08 - 00:40:44:11
H. Louis Sirkin
She was really mad about it. She was mad at the jury. How'd they do it so fast, you promised me they would still be out. But it was really, really exciting and it was a great thing it in. But in one other way, it was, it was very, very important. The case for the National Endowment for the Arts, when the controversy started at the Corcoran, and before about the same time that this was all going on, there was the Serrano piss Christ thing, which was that cross immersed in urine.

00:40:44:13 - 00:41:22:00
H. Louis Sirkin
And just a lot of controversy over that in Congress was just getting bombarded with people, why are we sponsoring and giving money to that? And when people didn't realize with the exhibit, did have some National Endowment of the Art funds, but the money that they got from the National Endowment for the Arts was used to print the catalog at the perfect moment, and deliberately the X, Y, Z portfolio was not in the X, Y, Z portfolio and in the in.

00:41:22:00 - 00:41:50:06
H. Louis Sirkin
In the catalog. And it was deliberately not in that because of they wanted to avoid controversy. What added to a lot of the controversy locally is that when it was known that the show was coming here, the news media really picked up on it and they had gone and taken a copy of the catalog to our Sherrif Si Leis and showed it to him.

00:41:50:08 - 00:42:19:14
H. Louis Sirkin
And Si looked at it. The two pictures of the children were in the catalog, but the other pictures were not. And he said, look, there's no problem with it. And then the news went oh the sheriff says, there's nothing wrong with it, you know, all that. And then what happened was, is that somebody then decided to show Lies some pictures of the X Y Z portfolio, which were contained in the catalog of the of a Whitney catalog.

00:42:19:16 - 00:42:56:06
H. Louis Sirkin
And they went and they took him. They showed him those pictures in the Whitney. Then he thought he had been deliberately kind of suckered, you know, into you know that they deliberately didn't show him that. And so that stirred a lot of controversy. And he was upset with that. And prior to the show coming here, maybe like a month before the show came here, the UC law school had a program that wanted- had a panel to discuss where have we gone about fighting words in First Amendment issues.

00:42:56:08 - 00:43:24:12
H. Louis Sirkin
I don't know if you're familiar with the case called Brandenburg, which is the case that said that if you- it's protected free speech, except if you give or say something that is likely to bring an immediate, an immediate retaliatory breach of the peace, we call that fighting words, then it is not protected, protected speech. But I tell you, let's go.

00:43:24:12 - 00:43:44:10
H. Louis Sirkin
I'll go from here. You guys all go get your guns out of your house, and we're going to go invade some place, that won't immediately bring you. But if you're all sitting here and you've got knives and guns and I say, okay, let's go. And there's a football game going on and we're going down there to get the crowd that would be inciting, you know, something.

00:43:44:10 - 00:44:22:01
H. Louis Sirkin
And that's the big controversy going on about January 6th. But back then that was the Brandenburg case and a UC law school graduate argued Brandenburg in the 60s or 70s. And so they wanted to do an update. And I was on the panel. That lawyer was on the panel. Cincinnati's then vice mayor was on the panel and general counsel for the Citizens for Community Values, which was very similar to the American Family Association and very anti this exhibit.

00:44:22:03 - 00:44:51:14
H. Louis Sirkin
And they were a very powerful group locally in stirred a lot of controversy and caused a lot of difficulty for the CAC. Their general counsel was on the panel and during the course of that the discussion got to the upcoming Mapplethorpe exhibit that was going to come to Cincinnati. And I remember our vice mayor saying that he had seen some of Mapplethorpe's works on display in an exhibit at the University of Dayton.

00:44:51:16 - 00:45:25:02
H. Louis Sirkin
And he raved about the quality of the pictures and, Alan Brown and then the counsel for the, CA- for the CCV took out some photo, you know, Xerox copies of the two pictures of the kids and started to say, look at these, these pictures of these children masturbating. And which was just absurd. It was a lie in, you know, and Alan grabbed these pictures in the theater and show it to the audience.

00:45:25:04 - 00:45:53:21
H. Louis Sirkin
And he spread it through and nobody had any problem looking at his pictures. That's the kind of attitude that they really created with it. They brought so much reaction. I mean, it was just ridiculous. You know, people were sending in, you know, Master Charge and Visa cards. It just started about that time and people were sending their master charge charge cards back to then Central Trust Bank, which is now PNC Bank.

00:45:53:23 - 00:46:21:15
H. Louis Sirkin
And the chairman of the board of the Contemporary Arts Center at the time was an executive vice president with Central Trust Bank. He was- he had to quit his job because of the pressure that was being levied against them, against the bank, and that the attempt at secondary boycotts. And I guess the next question is always, what did we learn from it and what is what is developed as a result?

00:46:21:17 - 00:46:55:15
H. Louis Sirkin
We saved- We saved the National Endowment for the Arts. It's still around. It's very much tamer now, as a result of the controversy. They're very picky in choosy know and don't- aren't as willing to go ahead on the line as much as before. We found that shortly after the exhibit ended here, the Contemporary Arts Center kind of mellowed what they would show in exhibits.

00:46:55:17 - 00:47:23:12
H. Louis Sirkin
We as part of the arrangement we had with the CAC was that from the fees that we received, we would sponsor an exhibit and we, of course, picked out an exhibit that we thought was a little bit controversial because it would stay consistent with it all. They push that back, that exhibit to another year, and they started to try to bridge.

00:47:23:12 - 00:48:05:05
H. Louis Sirkin
The gap of the controversy. And had an exhibit that portrayed, a lot of the artworks that are at prominent offices throughout the city of Cincinnati, that during the time of the controversy, the CAC withdrew itself from the United Arts Fund, because they were afraid it would affect the symphony, the Taft Museum, and that, you know, the art museum up in Walnut Hills and Eden Park and like, things like the playhouse and the park and that all the other institutions in the city were reluctant.

00:48:05:05 - 00:48:32:21
H. Louis Sirkin
Art institutions were reluctant as a facility like the museum, like the symphony or the, you know, the Cincinnati Art Museum to come out and publicly support the CAC. They were noncommittal, although a couple of the directors of these museums did come out supportive. But the CAC had withdrawn themselves from participating in it, and they eventually have gone back to it.

00:48:32:21 - 00:48:54:13
H. Louis Sirkin
But it really caused a lot of problems. I'm sure. Dennis Berry aged considerably. He had two children who at the time were students at Walnut Hills and it was a tough time for them, with it. But I have noticed on a national scale afterwards, although there was a lot of writing about it and everything else.

00:48:54:13 - 00:49:20:16
H. Louis Sirkin
But since it was the first museum to ever be charged with a criminal offense in the United States, and none have ever been charged since, but everybody got a little bit afraid. And there is still, you know, a long period of a lot of self-censorship. And of course, right now where we are with free speech issues, everybody's afraid to say anything.

00:49:20:18 - 00:49:50:15
H. Louis Sirkin
You never know. There's just so many groups in opposition, and it's a really, very trying time. And one of the things that is, kind of said to myself that I think First Amendment lawyers are needed right now who really believe strongly that there shouldn't be any prior restraints except is defined that you can't create or incite riots or violence.

00:49:50:17 - 00:50:13:18
H. Louis Sirkin
That were needed because we remember back, we've been around long enough to to know the fights that we had through the 70s and the 80s. I mean, to me, when I when I look at the list of censored books again, I mean, these are books that they were prominent and people were making a problem in the 1950s. I'm just- the Catcher in the Rye, Judy Blume books.

00:50:13:18 - 00:50:45:07
H. Louis Sirkin
I mean, it's just incredible. I mean, they've just, you know, one of the most censored authors in America is Judy Blume. Yeah. I mean, it's gone on for years. And, you know, we thought, you know, ten, 15 years ago, we thought, boy, we've heard of that. We've come a long way. Censorship is really, whatever. And now it's just, you all at the university being afraid to say anything in the classroom.

00:50:45:09 - 00:51:10:20
H. Louis Sirkin
Protests are back up. We got rid of all these speech codes and our battles, and we're back in, and I just came back from Washington for my First Amendment Lawyers Association meeting, and just horrified of all the battles that are going on all over the country at all the universities. So, and you know, that hope is the pendulum and pendulum could be shift again and maybe we'll get back.

00:51:10:20 - 00:51:42:17
H. Louis Sirkin
But, the positive for the city of Cincinnati, in a way, was is it the support for the CAC, became so overwhelming at the time that they were able to get funds to to build that really phenomenal building that they've got. And the contemporary Art center, which ironically, is, the offices that I'm in, we're like two doors away from the CAC, so I end up back to there.

00:51:42:19 - 00:52:06:08
H. Louis Sirkin
From the lawyering standpoint, the disappointment is, is that, we thought about writing a book, but we were lawyers, Mark and I were lawyers, and our our primary concern was we'd be gone from our practices and didn't go around do that. We did a lot of a lot of speaking engagements for free universities and law schools and groups.

00:52:06:09 - 00:52:34:17
H. Louis Sirkin
In that, in shortly after the exhibit closed, HBO wanted to we wanted to do a movie about it, and they were willing to pay the CAC for it. And the CAC didn't want to. They just wanted everything to just quiet down. It's like your kid got that bad ticket and we got him off, or he paid a small fine and forget about it.

00:52:34:19 - 00:52:58:18
H. Louis Sirkin
They wouldn't do it. And ten years later, Showtime did do one. And, you know, the disappointment of it is it wasn't a documentary. It was a movie. And so it gives a little bit of a taste of what the controversy was, but it's not I mean, it wasn't really the battle that went on. It was made it.

00:52:58:19 - 00:53:24:20
H. Louis Sirkin
Craig Nelson played the sheriff and James Wood play Dennis Barrie. And so the movie concentrated to them and not the whole picture. And so they kind of made it a story. Although it won a Golden Globe Award. But it was it was very disappointing. And, although it was neat to have you know somebody playing you in a movie, but, we were really disappointed with it.

00:53:24:22 - 00:53:38:14
H. Louis Sirkin
And, and every, you know, it'll be 30 years. Now it'll be, it'll be 35 years come couple, couple months from now, they'll be back and it'll be back in the news.

00:53:38:16 - 00:53:46:11
Jordan
Yeah. Okay. Well, I've covered a lot of it. Let me see here to follow up.

00:53:46:13 - 00:54:22:08
H. Louis Sirkin
The one other thing. That was- I think I should have mentioned, we deliberately restricted, who could attend the exhibit. We decided that arbitrarily. And it was on the advice of counsel that not to let anyone in under the age of 18. And the reason for that was, is that there's a statute. It's a criminal offense to display or to expose to anybody anything material that may be considered, "harmful to a juvenile".

00:54:22:10 - 00:54:42:13
H. Louis Sirkin
And even though they might have been accompanied by a parent or whatever, we just didn't want to give, that as a, you know, some excuse to bring another charge. I do find out through the years that kids would come up to me and that young people came out there, you know, we were able to get in there. And I'd say how old were you then?

00:54:42:13 - 00:55:04:21
H. Louis Sirkin
How did you do it? And whatever else? Because the hard thing I had actually daughters, my two oldest ones were in college and so they were able to come see the exhibit. My youngest daughter was not. She was only 16. And so I would I absolutely wouldn't let her go. And she's now she's a she's a professor now at the Matt Joseph University.

00:55:04:21 - 00:55:32:02
H. Louis Sirkin
But, I absolutely was flat. You can't see it. And all she's ever got to see of it or the, the videotapes of the exhibit that we've continued to have. And my wife keeps saying, must I brought some of this stuff that's original stuff that you can look at, some of the pleadings that we filed and a little bit of some of the news, the, the hype that went on during it, was covered.

00:55:32:02 - 00:55:53:12
H. Louis Sirkin
But, you know, just it was worldwide and its coverage. But, you know, it if you think you're right and you've got a point to make, you should be able to speak it. And that's what we always say. If, you don't like what somebody said just say something back a little bit louder and that can take over the speech because it's really important.

00:55:53:12 - 00:56:35:06
H. Louis Sirkin
It's an important principle. It makes us different than any other place in the world. And it's the foundation of freedom. And artistic expression is important because it brings about self-reflection and it brings back categories of history is you might not remember it. I mean, today somebody recently sent me an article that he had written about his reflections of watching Willie Mays catch that hit the World Series from over his shoulder and it was so well written that one of my kids made the comment.

00:56:35:06 - 00:56:59:15
H. Louis Sirkin
It almost made me feel like I was there. And it's how we sort of study history as we learn. And the one who I think benefited overall the most was the Mapplethorpe Foundation, because it it made all these pictures, I think, banned in Boston. It made them in and they, they were very difficult to deal with during the trial.

00:56:59:19 - 00:57:31:10
H. Louis Sirkin
And they ultimately made the benefit. They made a movie, called Mapplethorpe. That was maybe about ten years ago that came out and totally ignored saying anything about what the outcome of the controversy was here in Cincinnati, which I thought was shocking because it's what really made that thing, so big and so profitable to them. Now.

00:57:31:12 - 00:57:33:17
Jordan
For fellows.

00:57:33:19 - 00:57:41:01
Skyler
I just may have been covered, but did you talk about them dropping out of this entire fine arts fund? Pardon? Did you talk about them dropping out of Cincinnati?

00:57:41:02 - 00:57:45:21
H. Louis Sirkin
Yeah, I did, talked about that. And and.

00:57:45:23 - 00:57:59:04
Skyler
What about, talking a little bit more about the efforts to happen from, citizens for Community Values before the exhibit and how that affected I. I know you covered it a little bit, but just expanding on that a little more.

00:57:59:04 - 00:58:35:00
H. Louis Sirkin
Yeah, they were very organized. They I think were instrumental in getting the news media involved. They were the ones who I think really agitated or got, the news media to go talk to our sheriff. And I do believe that they were instrumental in in bringing him the Whitney eventually catalog, but and were very much involved in the attempted secondary boycotting that went on.

00:58:35:00 - 00:59:04:16
H. Louis Sirkin
I mean, they, they just had planned activities of members to send, their credit cards back to the Central Trust Bank and, or cancel their accounts and put a lot of pressure on a lot of businesses. They were well founded that they had been very active in the greater Cincinnati area from probably in the early part of the 70s until really after Mapplethorpe.

00:59:04:18 - 00:59:57:08
H. Louis Sirkin
This the CCV lost a lot of that, the power and influence that they had. But they they were very much involved in getting our prosecutor to bring nuisance abatement actions against adult businesses that, for one time were beginning to spring up in in Cincinnati. And as you notice there, other than the two hustler stores that are here, one of which sells it, no media material at all, and the other one very little, is a result that nobody, after so many nuisance cases being brought in, buildings and land owners being threatened with their buildings being shut down for a year unless they posted bonds.

00:59:57:08 - 01:00:23:22
H. Louis Sirkin
For the amount of the value of the property just simply will not rent to anybody that has anything that indicates that they're going to have anything that's sexually explicit. I mean, the bookstores we only have like, you know, certainly Barnes and Noble one have the one in Joseph Beth and bookstores like that and some other newsstands, but you don't find that there's anybody on a regular basis the nearest of anything.

01:00:23:22 - 01:00:51:11
H. Louis Sirkin
Are you were outside of the outside of Hamilton County, but they were very, very active. And, and I think that they believed and I think that Cincinnati, after the controversy in Washington, you know, certainly was to believe that Boston well, Boston did have a little bit of a stir, but nobody was going to complain in Chicago or Berkeley, California and places like that and in Philadelphia.

01:00:51:13 - 01:01:22:00
H. Louis Sirkin
But once that that happened in Washington, I think they said, you know, we can really do it. We can make our point in Cincinnati in the, you know, stronghold with it. The other thing that that the contemporary that the CCV was instrumental in, they were very active lobbyists. And prior to the Mapplethorpe case that the first offense for obscenity was only, is own, was only a misdemeanor which carried a penalty.

01:01:22:00 - 01:01:54:01
H. Louis Sirkin
That couldn't be more than a year in prison and a fine of $1,000. They got put a lot of pressure on the Ohio legislature afterwards to change that law to first offense being a felony. They also felt that the reason that because it was a misdemeanor, the county pushed it to the city. The county pushed it to the city because it would they had done their part and there was a no loss to them.

01:01:54:03 - 01:02:18:10
H. Louis Sirkin
And they they then thereafter, when, you know, came back in there was a the acquittal, the county blame, the city did a terrible job in prosecuting it and just simply isn't true. The two prosecutors that worked on the case worked their butt off and tried their hardest, we just were the right side. And in that the CCV was really instrumental in that.

01:02:18:12 - 01:03:00:18
H. Louis Sirkin
And it was after that when all the sexual registration stuff was beginning, that I predicted that in due time sale, or violation of the obscenity law would become a sexual, it would become a sexual registration violation, so that if the boys or the library at your library here at university, if anybody thinks the book is in the library is obscene and they can get somebody to prosecute it in the person that gets charged who's in control of the library can have to register as a sex offender for at least a minimum of 15 years, which is just absolutely.

01:03:00:18 - 01:03:05:17
H. Louis Sirkin
Incredible to believe that that that you know, that.

01:03:05:19 - 01:03:17:18
H. Louis Sirkin
that can happen, that it's happened. So they, they were they were really instrumental in, in the whole thing and very much behind it.

01:03:17:20 - 01:03:22:21
Jordan
Do you want to go more into, their arguments in court? Yeah. I mean.

01:03:22:23 - 01:03:28:16
Skyler
Even about it specifically, like how do you convince that jury, what the strategies were that.

01:03:28:18 - 01:04:03:07
H. Louis Sirkin
The strategy was simple. You had the- strategy. I had developed in obscenity prosecutions that the definition of obscenity is a three prong test, and it has to be all three. It can be, you know, appeal to a morbid or prurient interest in sex, it's not enough. If it isn't patently offensive, it's not enough. And if it taken as a whole has value and then does it and I compared it to if I'm, I would ask jurors that, look, you have to listen ultimately to the definition.

01:04:03:09 - 01:04:23:06
H. Louis Sirkin
And it's just like a recipe. If I'm going to make an apple pie. Yeah I get the flour and I make the dough and I do that and I cook it and all that, but I use cherries. You can call it an apple pie all you want, but it ain't an apple pie. An and so do you accept the principle that that's exactly what we have here.

01:04:23:11 - 01:04:48:03
H. Louis Sirkin
We have three ingredients and a bit misses any one of those ingredients. It doesn't fit in. And I had been using that very often in, in my trials in picking juries because it became something you can really relate to. That look. Okay. It's a maybe I think it's disgusting. And they get, you know, we don't like it, or whatever else.

01:04:48:03 - 01:05:13:06
H. Louis Sirkin
But remember I've got that, I've got the recipe. And if I'm not using apples, it's not an apple pie. And so we really built it around that. We also built it around, bringing in, you know, John Walsh, who at the time was, the director of the Getty Museum in California, which was a very avant garde there.

01:05:13:06 - 01:05:44:00
H. Louis Sirkin
But John Walsh, was just the spitting image of Gregory Peck. He's a soft spoken big guy. We also used, a a gentleman by the name of Robert Sobieszek. He was the director of the Eastman Kodak Museum in New York, and Eastman Kodak at the time was like, you know, the thing. And it was just an every everybody had a camera and it was and it was a Kodak camera.

01:05:44:02 - 01:06:17:17
H. Louis Sirkin
And he was soft spoken and what shows another person from an art museum to the testifies to the quality of that and the artistic value was a young woman who was the assistant director in the Contemporary Art Museum at the University of Michigan. And but for the fact of this dislike and controversy between Michigan and Ohio State, Michigan, is a well thought of school around the Cincinnati Greater Cincinnati area.

01:06:17:19 - 01:06:54:10
H. Louis Sirkin
And it was just perfect. She had she had just accepted a job at Berkeley, but she still was listed as a faculty member at the University of Michigan. So our strategy was to use, although we had available, many, many experts who were willing to testify, the director of the Walker Museum in Minneapolis, which is a very avant garde museum, and that we used him in some preliminary matters, but didn't use him through the ultimate trial because we felt that, you know, that in Minneapolis, we avoided somebody from Baltimore, New York.

01:06:54:10 - 01:07:33:21
H. Louis Sirkin
We avoided it. Even at that time, Dayton was way ahead of us in its attitude about artistic value and and things that way. And we avoided using the director of the museum up in Dayton. But they were all very supportive, in that so that that was really our strategy. I, I did pull in. I mean, I had a theory at the time, I used very often in the adult cases that the average person of Cincinnati, like the average person in most major metropolitan areas of the country, have a normal, healthy interest in sex.

01:07:33:22 - 01:08:02:22
H. Louis Sirkin
And if material appeals to you, then, it's not morbid or shameful. I mean, there's nothing morbid and shameful about human sexuality in and of itself. In order to believe that material appeals to a morbid interest, you have to believe that we all have a morbid interest inside of us that can be tapped and and that and just logic tells you that.

01:08:02:23 - 01:08:31:00
H. Louis Sirkin
And I used to argue that that look you may not like it. And I'm not telling you that you have to watch it. And, but remember, you didn't choose to watch it. You didn't choose to to sit on this jury that policeman also, you didn't choose what you're going to look at, a policeman at that board, that movie and that there in that movie place, or that police officer that ordered that video V-.

01:08:31:03 - 01:08:54:22
H. Louis Sirkin
You know mail order, chose that for you to see. And this isn't designed to be watched. And, you know, with nine other people or ten other people that you've never met before and where you're expected to go talk about the contents later on. It's something that you're going to watch by yourself or with some significant other, in the privacy of your own home.

01:08:55:00 - 01:09:26:17
H. Louis Sirkin
And to me, that is an example of allowing people to make those choices. To me is political value from community if a community or tolerate different viewpoints? And it worked. And very often I never in adult cases ever had to use an expert witness because I'd argue that. But here. So we argued a little bit of that, but we really didn't need to do that because we really, truly had I mean, this was artistic stuff.

01:09:26:19 - 01:09:30:11
H. Louis Sirkin
And so we were able to really argue that.

01:09:30:12 - 01:09:38:20
Skyler
And we all had our allotted time for I would have to put more meaning that come back.

01:09:38:20 - 01:09:52:13
Jordan
And I want to keep going. Found. Are you good? Okay. That's all. We're quite nice for you then. You don't ask anything else? Yeah. Is there anything else you just want to mention while we're here?

01:09:52:15 - 01:09:55:01
Skyler
Where do you feel you covered at all? Okay, good.

01:09:55:03 - 01:09:56:17
Jordan
Good, good.

01:09:56:19 - 01:09:59:10
H. Louis Sirkin
I talked about it enough. No.

01:09:59:11 - 01:10:03:00
Jordan
Really. I would love.
